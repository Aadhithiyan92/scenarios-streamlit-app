The "bullwhip effect" refers to increasing swings in inventory in response to changes in customer demand
as one moves up the supply chain. Even small changes in consumer demand can result in large variations in
orders at the wholesale, distributor, and manufacturer levels.

**Causes revealed by Systems Dynamics:**
1. **Information delays** - Time lags in recognizing and responding to demand changes
2. **Order batching** - Placing orders in larger, less frequent batches to save on transaction costs
3. **Rationing and shortage gaming** - Ordering more when supply is tight
4. **Price fluctuations** - Buying more during promotions or discounts

Traditional models often miss these dynamics, leading to excess inventory, stockouts,
poor customer service, and higher costs throughout the supply chain.
